# Computing for Research 2022 Bootcamp Materials
This repo houses data and notebooks for the 2022 DSEER "Computing for Research" bootcamp.

## Instructions:
0) Follow the setup instructions on [this page](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#setup) titled "The Bash Shell", "Git" and "Python". Basically, everything under "Setup" not including "R" or "text editor." 
      - For python, install Anaconda.
      - The videos may be helpful. 
      - These additional tutorials may also be helpful to skim:
            _Unix shell/command line:_ http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/
            _Version control with git:_ http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/
1) If you don't already have a preffered text editor, install the free version of BBEdit [here](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/). If you already use a text editor you are familiar with, you can skip this step.
2) Open Terminal or other application for the bash or zsh command line (for Windows its the git bash introduced in the instructions above, for Mac and Linux its the Terminal)
3) `cd` into a directory that you want all of your bootcamp materials to live.
4) Type `git clone https://github.com/NRT-DSEER/computing-for-research-2022.git`
5) Type `cd intro-programming-2022`
6) You're all set up! To start using notebooks, type `cd notebooks` and then type `jupyter notebook` 
7) This should open a new tab in your default browser and print a bunch of stuff in your terminal.
8) In the new tab that was just opened in your browser, click the notebook for the day of the course that you are on. For the first day, open "Day1_Setup.ipynb" and follow the instructions in that notebook to make sure you followed all the steps correctly.
9) Each day, start class by going into your bootcamp repo directory (`cd intro-programming-2022`) and typing `git pull`. Then follow steps 6-8.

## Directory Structure:
`data` holds data

`notebooks` holds notebooks

`output` is where you will save your own files

Don't change the structure!
