# Computing for Research 2022 Bootcamp Materials
This repo houses data and notebooks for the 2022 DSEER "Computing for Research" bootcamp.

## TO DO BEFORE BOOTCAMP BEGINS:
1) Follow the setup instructions on [this page](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#setup) titled "The Bash Shell", "Git" and "Python". Basically, everything under "Setup" not including "R" or "text editor." 
      - For python, install Anaconda.
      - The videos may be helpful. 
      - These additional tutorials may also be helpful to skim:
            _Unix shell/command line:_ http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/
            _Version control with git:_ http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/
2) If you don't already have a preffered text editor, install the free version of BBEdit [here](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/). If you already use a text editor you are familiar with, you can skip this step.
